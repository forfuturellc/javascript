# why a style guide

Style guides allow us to write source code in a **consistent style**. This in turn maximizes productivity while inspecting such code.


# why ANOTHER style guide

While many style guides for JavaScript exist out there, we wanted a guide that met our standards with reasons rather than dogma. Every point made in this guide is written down accompained with reasons why. If we can not support why we prefer a certain method over the other, then such a guide would be misleading.

# Note

This is **not** a JavaScript tutorial. We won't go over all aspects of the programming language. We only focus on areas where we prefer a certain way of doind things over another.
